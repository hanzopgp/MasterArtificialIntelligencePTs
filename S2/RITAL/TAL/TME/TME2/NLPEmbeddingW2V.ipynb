    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use statistical classifiers with text, it is first necessary to vectorize the text. In the first practical session we explored the **bag of word** model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modern **state of the art** methods uses  embeddings to vectorize the text before classification in order to avoid feature engineering.\n",

    "## \"Modern\" NLP pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "By opposition to the **bag of word** model, in the modern NLP pipeline everything is **embeddings**. Instead of encoding a text as a **sparse vector** of length $D$ (size of feature dictionnary) the goal is to encode the text in a meaningful dense vector of a small size $|e| <<< |D|$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw classification pipeline is then the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "raw text ---|embedding table|-->  vectors --|Neural Net|--> class \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a  language model:\n",
    "\n",
    "How to tokenize the text and extract a feature dictionnary is still a manual task. To directly have meaningful embeddings, it is common to use a pre-trained language model such as `word2vec` which we explore in this practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, the pipeline becomes the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "      \n",
    "raw text ---|(pre-trained) Language Model|--> vectors --|classifier (or fine-tuning)|--> class \n",

What a great face that man has!<br /><br />The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.\", 1]\n",

      "['Although credit should have been given to Dr. Seuess for stealing the story-line of \"Horton Hatches The Egg\", this was a fine film. It touched both the emotions and the intellect. Due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old Justin Henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each one\\'s predicament), the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over. Overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent directing, and a very powerful script. The right touches of humor throughout help keep a \"heavy\" subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through. Lastly, this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated, decades after it was released.', 1]\n",
