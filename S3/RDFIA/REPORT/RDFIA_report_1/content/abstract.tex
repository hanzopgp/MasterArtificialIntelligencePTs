The goal of the project is to understand how feature extraction works while studying images. Thanks to SIFT descriptor and BOW (Bag Of Words), we transform an image dataset into a vector dataset. After extracting the features of each images, we train a machine learning model (Support Vector Machine - SVM) to classify those images thanks to supervised learning. The SVM hyper-parameters were chosen thanks to GridSearch, an implementation in the Scikit-learn library that helps choosing the best set of parameters from a range of tried values. We manage to get 74\% accuracy on the test set.
