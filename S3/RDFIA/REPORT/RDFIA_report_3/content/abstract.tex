The goal of this practical work is to understand the different types of transfer learning with a focus on computer vision. Some tools such as saliency maps can also help us understand the inside of neural networks. Thanks to these we can see how adversarial attacks work in computer vision. After that we worked on domain adaptation and generative adversarial networks.
