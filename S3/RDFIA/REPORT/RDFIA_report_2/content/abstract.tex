The goal of this practical work is to understand the basic of neural networks. We implemented the training procedure by coding backpropagation, initialisation, forward pass by hand. Then we do it thanks to PyTorch and torch.nn, torch.autograd, torch.optim... First we will do it for the multi layer perceptron, and then we will do it on a convolutional architecture.
