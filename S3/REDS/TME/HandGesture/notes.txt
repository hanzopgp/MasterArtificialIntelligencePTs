Variance in data because people do not execute the exact same hand gesture during data acquisition.
Split between users for the validation to avoid overfit.

Experimental protocol

Data description:
angles are in degree
0 --> 21 index: angles provided by the glove
22 --> 28 index: pitch angles to differentiate gestures with similar handshapes and distinct orientation

Experimental protocol:
	evaluation: 
		- classification report to spot harder classes and to think about it
		- human in the loop check in order to spot errors
		- from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
		- from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
